# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it by emailing the maintainer directly rather than opening a public issue.

Since this is a data-only registry (no executable code), security concerns are most likely to involve:

- Malicious URL patterns designed to redirect traffic
- Incorrect vendor attribution (impersonation)

We will respond to reports as quickly as possible.
